# Drawing Simulator



## Description
A mario-themed drawing simulator that simulates a 2D creative drawing experience with options to change colors and experiment with different images to create a work of art!

I created a drawing simulator using Java as the back-end language with multiple renderers, fragments, camera angles, coordinates, component systems, batching, and resource management. 

OpenGL was used for window handling along with the majority of graphics uploaded.

When resetting the simulator grid, ensure that the .levels file is cleared and deleted.
